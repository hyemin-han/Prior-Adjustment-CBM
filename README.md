# Testing different meta-analyses for prior determination in voxelwise Bayesian second-level fMRI analysis

To test voxelwise Bayesian second-level fMRI with a prior distribution determined by meta-analysis, run "run_meta_test.py"
Caution: before running the example run_meta_test.py listed below, modify "cores" variable according to the number of cores available on your system. For instance, if you intend to run the code with four cores (CPUs), then "cores = 4"

# Run your own analysis
Source code and required files are available ./src. First, copy all nii files (including mask.nii generated from frequentist analysis (e.g,. SPM)) into the same folder. Second, modify "./src/list.csv" to include names of all nii files to be analyzed. Third, modify C (mean contrast), N (noise strength; in this study, standard deviation of all analyzed voxels), R (proportion of significant voxels), cores values in ./src/run_meta_test.py. Fourth, run "run_meta_test.py"
